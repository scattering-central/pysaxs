saxskit: Python modules for small angle x-ray scattering data analysis 
======================================================================


Description
-----------

This package uses data-driven models to analyze SAXS data.
The models are trained from a set SAXS spectra
that have been analyzed and curated on the Citrination platform.

SAXS spectra employed in this package 
are attributed to the following sources:

 - Wu, Liheng, et al. Nature 548, 197â€“201 (2017). doi: 10.1038/nature23308

As more spectra are added to the curated set, 
the models behind this package are expected to become more effective.
If you have a SAXS data set that you would like to volunteer
to add to the curated set, 
please contact the development team at
ssrl-citrination@slac.stanford.edu or paws-developers@slac.stanford.edu.


Example
-------

This example profiles, parameterizes, 
and optimizes the fit of a scattering equation
to a measured saxs spectrum.

**Read intensivity n-by-2 array `q_I` from a csv file:** ::

    import numpy as np
    q_i = np.genfromtxt ('my_data/sample_0.csv', delimiter=",")

**Import saxskit:** ::

    import saxskit

**Profile a saxs spectrum:** ::

    from saxskit.saxs_math import profile_spectrum
    features = profile_spectrum(q_i)

To predict scatters populations we can use SAXSKIT models (built on Sklearn) or Citrination models.

**Using SAXSKIT models:**

* Initialize SaxsClassifier and **predicted scatterer populations**: ::

    from saxskit.saxs_classify import SaxsClassifier
    m = SaxsClassifier()
    populations, probability = m.classify(features)
    for k,v in populations.items():
        print(k, ":", v, "  with probability: %1.3f" % (probability[k]))
    print()

| unidentified : 0   with probability: 0.998
| guinier_porod : 0   with probability: 0.775
| spherical_normal : 1   with probability: 0.996
| diffraction_peaks : 0   with probability: 1.000


* Initialize SaxsRegressor and **predict counting scatterer parameters**: ::

    from saxskit.saxs_regression import SaxsRegressor
    r = SaxsRegressor()
    params = r.predict_params(populations,features, q_i)


* Initialize SaxsFitter and **update scatterer parameters with intensity parametes**: ::

    from saxskit import saxs_fit
    sxf = saxs_fit.SaxsFitter(q_i,populations)
    params, report = sxf.fit_intensity_params(params)
    for k,v in params.items():
        print(k, ":", end="")
        for n in v:
            print(" %10.3f" % (n))

| I0_floor :      0.663
| I0_sphere :   2601.258
| r0_sphere :     26.690
| sigma_sphere :      0.048
|


**Using Citrination models:**

*  Create SaxsCitrination using Citrination credentials: ::

    from saxskit.saxs_citrination import CitrinationSaxsModels

    api_key_file = 'path_to_my_api_key_txt'
    saxs_models = CitrinationSaxsModels(api_key_file,'https://slac.citrination.com')

* Predict scatterer populations::

    populations, uncertainties = saxs_models.classify(features)
    for k,v in populations.items():
        print(k, ":", v, "  with uncertainties: %1.3f" % (uncertainties[k]))
    print()


| unidentified : 0   with uncertainties: 0.008
| guinier_porod : 0   with uncertainties: 0.034
| spherical_normal : 1   with uncertainties: 0.005
| diffraction_peaks : 0   with uncertainties: 0.010


* Predict counting scatterer parameters: ::

    params,uncertainties = saxs_models.predict_params(populations, features, q_i)
    for k,v in params.items():
        print(k, ":", v, " +/- %1.3f" % (uncertainties[k]))
    print()

| r0_sphere : [28.055669297520605]  +/- 0.907
| sigma_sphere : [0.094776319721295]  +/- 0.087

* Initialize SaxsFitter and **update scatterer parameters with intensity parametes**: ::

    sxf = saxs_fit.SaxsFitter(q_i,populations)
    params, report = sxf.fit_intensity_params(params)
    for k,v in params.items():
        print(k, ":", end="")
        for n in range(len(v)):
            print(" %10.3f" % (v[n]) )
    print()

| I0_floor :      0.540
| I0_sphere :   3202.553
| r0_sphere :     28.056
| sigma_sphere :      0.095
