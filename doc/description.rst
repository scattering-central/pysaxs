Description
-----------

This package uses data-driven models to analyze SAXS data.
The models are trained from a set SAXS spectra
that have been analyzed and curated on the Citrination platform.

SAXS spectra employed in this package
are attributed to the following sources:

 - Wu, Liheng, et al. Nature 548, 197â€“201 (2017). doi: 10.1038/nature23308

As more spectra are added to the curated set,
the models behind this package are expected to become more effective.
If you have a SAXS data set that you would like to volunteer
to add to the curated set,
please contact the development team at
ssrl-citrination@slac.stanford.edu or paws-developers@slac.stanford.edu.
