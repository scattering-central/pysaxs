xrsdkit: Python modules for x-ray scattering and diffraction data analysis 
==========================================================================


Description
-----------

This package supports a data ecosystem for 
X-ray scattering and diffraction patterns,
notably including tools to curate datasets 
and build statistical models for automated analysis.
The package includes a set of models
trained on data curated by the developers
at Stanford Synchrotron Radiaton Lightsource (SSRL),
a directorate of the Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC) laboratory.

Data employed for the packaged models 
are attributed to the following sources:

 - Wu, Liheng, et al. Nature 548, 197â€“201 (2017). doi: 10.1038/nature23308

As more patterns are added to the curated set, 
the models are expected to become more effective.
If you have a data set that you would like to volunteer
to add to the curated set, 
please contact the development team at
ssrl-citrination@slac.stanford.edu or paws-developers@slac.stanford.edu.


Installation
------------

This package is hosted on PyPI. Install it by `pip install xrsdkit`
