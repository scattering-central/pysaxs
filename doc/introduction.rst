Introduction
============

Xrsdkit provides a data-driven modeling framework
for scattering and diffraction patterns.
This includes tools for: 

    - data analysis (least-squares fitting of patterns)
    - curation of analysis results to build modeling datasets
    - training predictive models from curated datasets
    - application of trained models to analyze new samples

These tools can be used in Python scripts 
or with the included (equally functional) GUI.

The full package documentation is here:

The package is hosted and developed here:
https://github.com/scattering-central/xrsdkit

Example datasets and trained models are here:

Stable versions are released on PyPI. 
Install the latest release by::

    pip install xrsdkit
