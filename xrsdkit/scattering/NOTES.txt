# Summary of interface for lattice and space group support:
#
# The user should select a lattice,
# and then select one of the associated space groups.
# If the user attempts to set a space group that does not match the lattice, 
# an Exception should be raised.
#
# If polyatomic, the selected space group should impose constraints
# on the coordinates of species in the basis.
# If a space group is selected and the coordinates 
# do not agree with the selected space group,
# the coordinates should be corrected or an Exception should be raised.
#
# The point group of the selected space group should be used 
# to symmetrize the sum over reciprocal space for the diffraction computation.
