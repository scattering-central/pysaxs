# Summary of interface for lattice and space group support:
#
# The user should select a lattice,
# and then select one of the associated space groups.
# By default, if the basis contains only one specie,
# the highest-symmetry space group for that lattice should be applied.
# If the basis contains more than one specie,
# the default should be the lowest-symmetry space group for that lattice.
# If the user attempts to set a space group that does not match the lattice, 
# an Exception should be raised.
#
# The selected space group should impose constraints
# on the coordinates of species in the basis.
# If a space group is selected and the coordinates 
# do not agree with the selected space group,
# the coordinates should be corrected or an Exception should be raised.
#
# The selected space group should be mapped to its point group,
# and the point group should be used to symmetrize
# the sum over reciprocal space for the diffraction computation.
